## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing and implementing a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) receiver part using VHDL. The primary objective is to gain fundamental skills necessary for designing and simulating digital circuits using professional tools.

## Files Description

- `uart.vhdl` - Contains the UART receiver's VHDL code focusing on data reception and processing from the serial link.
- `uart_fsm.vhdl` - Contains the VHDL code for the finite state machine (FSM) controlling the UART receiver logic.
- `zadini.pdf` - Provides detailed project guidelines and specifications in Czech.
- `zprava.pdf` - design report for the UART receiver project.
